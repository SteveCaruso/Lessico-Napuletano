# Lessico Napuletano
A lexicon of the Neapolitan language.

Napuletano (Neapolitan, ISO-639 code *nap*) is a language spoken throughout the regions of Campania, Abruzzo, Molise, Basilicata, western Apulia, northern Calabria, and the southern portions of Lazio and Marche. It is also one of the major Italian languages that was brought over to North America during the great migrations of the early 1900s along with Sicilian, Calabrian, and Standard Italian.

This project is an effort to build a lexicon from works in the Neapolitan language from its early period, through the unification period from the mid 1800s to the early 1900s, and then up through the present day. This poses some significant challenges because the language, throughout its time and range, was never standardized so alternate spellings and writing conventions will have to be addressed.

Another goal for this project is to make use of flatfile databases in an effort to future-proof the work, as well as develop some means of translation localization.

As a result, there is a *lot* of work to be done!
