# Lessico Napuletano
A lexicon of the Neapolitan language.

Napuletano (Neapolitan, ISO-639 code nap) is a language spoken throughout the regions of Campania, Abruzzo, Molise, Basilicata, western Apulia, northern Calabria, and the southern portions of Lazio and Marche. It is also one of the major Italian languages that was brought over to North America during the great migrations of the early 1900s along with Sicilian, Calabrian, and Standard Italian.

This project is an effort to build a lexicon of public domain works in the Neapolitan language from its early period through the unification period from the mid 1800s to the early 1900s up through present day. There is a *lot* of work to be done!

Another goal is to do so using flatfile databases in an effort to future-proof the work as the use of Napuletano is in slow decline with the continuing use of Standard Italian.
